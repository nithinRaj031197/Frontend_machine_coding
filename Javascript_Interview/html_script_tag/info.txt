What is use of defer and async in script tag of html?

    Defer:
        1. defer is an attribute used in the script tag within html file.
        2. When defer is added, the browser will parse HTML contents and simultaneouly fetch the external
            script.
        3. The script is loaded only after the HTML contents is completed.

        <script src="path-to-your-script.js" defer></script>


    Async: 
        1. Async is an attribute used in the script tag within html file.
        2. The script will be fetched asynchronously along with the html contents, and executed
            as soon as its available.
        3. This can potentially lead to out-of-order execution, as script might load before rest of the 
            HTML elements is parsed.

            <script src="path-to-your-script.js" async></script>
