1. Event Propogation:
    * Refers to process by which events are handled and they are passed through DOM hirerachy when they occurs as HTML elements.
    * When an event, such as a mouse click or a keypress, happens on an element, it can trigger event handlers not 
      only on that specific element but also on its parent elements and even higher up the DOM tree.

2. There are two main phases of event propagation:

    * Bubbling Phase:
        In the bubbling phase, the event starts from the target element that triggered the event and bubbles up
        through its ancestors in the DOM hierarchy, triggering event handlers on each ancestor along the way.

    * Capturing Phase:
        In the capturing phase (also known as trickling phase), the event starts from the top-level ancestor and
        moves down the DOM hierarchy towards the target element, triggering event handlers on each ancestor.

3. Event Delegation:
    * Attaching an event listener to higher-level element(such as parent or ancestor element)
        in DOM hierarchy, rather than attaching individual child elements.
