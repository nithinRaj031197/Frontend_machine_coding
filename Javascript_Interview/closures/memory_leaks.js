// Using closures effectively without causing memory leaks involves understanding how closures capture variables and references. Here's how to use closures safely and prevent memory leaks, along with an example:

// Using Closures Safely:
// Minimize the Scope:

// Keep the scope of closures as small as possible. Avoid unnecessary capturing of variables that won't be used by the closure.
// Avoid Capturing Large Objects:

// If a closure captures a large object (like a DOM element or a huge array), it can lead to memory leaks. Consider extracting only the required data from the object.
// Release References:

// When a closure is no longer needed, explicitly set the reference to it to null. This allows the JavaScript garbage collector to identify that the closure can be safely removed.
// Example: Preventing Memory Leaks with Closures:
// Let's say you have a scenario where you're attaching event listeners to elements using closures. To prevent memory leaks, make sure to remove the event listeners and release references to the closures when they're no longer needed.

function createClickHandler(element) {
  return function () {
    console.log(`Clicked on ${element.id}`);
  };
}

function attachEventListeners() {
  const button1 = document.getElementById("button1");
  const button2 = document.getElementById("button2");

  const clickHandler1 = createClickHandler(button1);
  const clickHandler2 = createClickHandler(button2);

  button1.addEventListener("click", clickHandler1);
  button2.addEventListener("click", clickHandler2);

  // ... Some code

  // To prevent memory leaks, remove event listeners and release closures

  button1.removeEventListener("click", clickHandler1);
  button2.removeEventListener("click", clickHandler2);
  clickHandler1 = null;
  clickHandler2 = null;
}

attachEventListeners();

// In this example, closures are used to create event handlers for buttons.
// However, if these closures are not properly managed, memory leaks can occur.
// By removing the event listeners and setting the closures to null after they're no longer
// needed, you ensure that the closures and associated event listeners are
// properly released and can be garbage collected.

// Preventing memory leaks with closures involves understanding the lifecycle of the closures
// and ensuring that references to them are properly managed and released when they're no longer needed.
